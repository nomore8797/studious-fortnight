# Security Policy

## Project status

This repository is a **research and experimental project**.

The codebase may include:
- unfinished features;
- experimental architectural decisions;
- intentional instability for research purposes.

This project is **not production-ready software** and comes **without guarantees of stability, safety, or fitness for any particular purpose**.

---

## Supported versions

Only the **latest version on the default branch** is considered for security review.

Older commits, forks, or experimental branches are **not supported**.

---

## What is considered a security vulnerability

We consider security issues that may reasonably lead to:

- Remote Code Execution (RCE)
- Unauthorized access to local or remote resources
- Leakage of sensitive data
- Dependency or supply-chain vulnerabilities affecting execution safety
- CI/CD or workflow configurations that expose secrets or execution context

---

## What is NOT considered a security vulnerability

The following are **out of scope**:

- Architectural or conceptual disagreements
- Experimental design choices
- Performance issues
- Lack of features or missing validations
- Crashes caused by incomplete or research-stage code
- Issues arising from running the project in unsupported environments

---

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you have found a **real security vulnerability**, please report it **privately** using GitHub Security Advisories:

- Do **not** open a public issue
- Do **not** publish the vulnerability before disclosure

Use the Security tab → “Report a vulnerability”.

Please include:
- a clear description of the issue;
- steps to reproduce (if applicable);
- the potential impact.

---

## Response policy

As this is a research project:

- There are **no guaranteed response times**
- Fixes may be delayed, partial, or declined
- Some reports may be acknowledged but not addressed

All reports will be reviewed **in good faith**.

---

## Responsible disclosure

We appreciate responsible disclosure and respectful communication.

Abusive, coercive, or deadline-driven demands will be ignored.
